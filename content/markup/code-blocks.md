> **Section Notes**
> :one: Any markdown character sequences inside **is treated as literal text**, and will not be rendered as Markdown.
> :two: Despite how it may render itself inside an intent with the WYSIWYG editor, it is perfectly valid Markdown given the behaviour.
> :three: Content provided after an indent *with a code block inside* will be rendered at least another line below.
